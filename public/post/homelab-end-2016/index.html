 Dedicated pfSense firewall was replaced with virtual Cisco ASAv firewall Replacing the firewall means I&amp;rsquo;m connecting my cable modem to my Cisco 3750 core switch Also replaced the virtual pfSense firewall on my dedicated server in Atlanta with a pair of active/standby ASAv firewalls Upgraded host-to-storage networking to 10Gb which included adding 3x10Gb interfaces to my FreeNAS box Moved from NFS to iSCSI for VMware datastore share in order to achieve a network configuration where I can direct connect ESXi hosts to FreeNAS while still having a single common datastore (with working vmotions, DRS, etc) Added an HP DL380 G7 to the lab (2x Xeon L5630, 96GB RAM, 4x 300GB 10k drives) Started migrating hosted projects from Kubernetes to OpenShift Origin  Wish list Of course these additions sparked some additions to my wish list:" />

<p>For those who have never seen this before: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/3twiy7/taking_advantage_of_the_cold_minnesota_winter/">yes, I did run fiber out to my shed</a>. I live in Minnesota and last winter I took advantage of the ridiculously cold winters we have and housed some servers out there.</p>
<h2 id="major-changes">Major changes<a href="#major-changes" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Here is a list of big changes made in the current revision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dedicated pfSense firewall was replaced with virtual Cisco ASAv firewall</li>
<li>Replacing the firewall means I&rsquo;m connecting my cable modem to my Cisco 3750 core switch</li>
<li>Also replaced the virtual pfSense firewall on my dedicated server in Atlanta with a pair of active/standby ASAv firewalls</li>
<li>Upgraded host-to-storage networking to 10Gb which included adding 3x10Gb interfaces to my FreeNAS box</li>
<li>Moved from NFS to iSCSI for VMware datastore share in order to achieve a network configuration where I can direct connect ESXi hosts to FreeNAS while still having a single common datastore (with working vmotions, DRS, etc)</li>
<li>Added an HP DL380 G7 to the lab (2x Xeon L5630, 96GB RAM, 4x 300GB 10k drives)</li>
<li>Started migrating hosted projects from Kubernetes to OpenShift Origin</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wish-list">Wish list<a href="#wish-list" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Of course these additions sparked some additions to my wish list:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 or 24-port 10Gb switch</li>
<li>Half-height 4-post rack</li>
<li>Additional UPS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-term-plans">Short-term plans<a href="#short-term-plans" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Here are some things I plan to tackle in the next 30 days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean up networks &ndash; too much shit where it shouldn&rsquo;t be</li>
<li>Switch config backup software (implement Rancid)</li>
<li>Get dedicated ESXi server off public-facing internet &ndash; currently my dedicated ESXi host management interface is internet-facing, which isn&rsquo;t ideal. I need to get this moved to be over my VPN tunnel WITHOUT making it impossible to recover should I lose my tunnel and need to restore services without vcenter access</li>
<li>Implement Cisco AnyConnect VPN</li>
<li>Setup VMware Horizon View again</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finally-a-picture">Finally, a picture<a href="#finally-a-picture" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>

<p>And the 10Gb networking from the FreeNAS box:</p>
