      <description>Perhaps the most frustrating thing about vCenter 6 is the hard 8GB of RAM requirement to simply install the application on a Windows server. To a lot of people, including myself, carving out 8GB of RAM VM in a home lab just to run vCenter for a host or two is a big ask.
But beyond that, even if you&amp;rsquo;re using a physical computer that has exactly 8GB of installed RAM, if any of that RAM goes to an integrated video card, and thus doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear available to Windows, you&amp;rsquo;ll be blocked from running the VCenter installer as your system will have slightly less than a full 8GB of RAM.</description>

      <title>recursive unrar script for windows</title>

      <description>This script, as well as similar scripts can be found on the internet but I tend to keep losing the pages that have it. So for my own archival reasons, as well as making it a little easier for others to find, here it is.
This script uses winrar to recursively extract rar archives. This is very useful if you legally download seasons of shows and don&amp;rsquo;t want to extract each episode one by one.</description>
