      <description>The goal of this exercise is to create a Metric for Sensu that&amp;rsquo;ll poll the Unifi controller and display the signal strength of connected wireless devices. This will allow me to get a visual of the type of connection devices in my house are getting as well as let me somewhat track the comings and goings of my devices.
Because no scripts like this currently exist for Unifi, I had to dig in and see what my options were.</description>
