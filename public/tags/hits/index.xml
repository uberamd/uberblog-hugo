      <description>HAProxy is my homelab loadbalancer of choice due to it&amp;rsquo;s versatility and general ease of configuration. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s HTTP or just plan TCP traffic I want to land within my lab, a few tweaks to an HAProxy config is all it takes. However, as I deploy more and more random services, which I want available from the internet, having to remote into my various HAProxy ingress servers becomes a pain. Also, since I like to have isolated HAProxy instances depending on what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, yet again having to remote into boxes to make changes becomes even more tiresome.</description>
