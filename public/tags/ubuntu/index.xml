      <description>Intro So you want to deploy Sentry in your local environment, eh? Assuming you already know what Sentry does, I&amp;rsquo;ll just give you the tagline from their website: Sentry provides real-time crash reporting for your web apps, mobile apps, and games. That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty fantastic summary. What I use it for is gathering, grouping, and alerting on Ruby on Rails application issues. It wraps errors up in to a nice, easy to digest package that you can work through, resolve, and get trend analysis on.</description>

      <description>The problem After getting my Ubuntu 15.04 desktop setup I noticed Chrome/Firefox was unable to properly resolve my local domain (*.home.local).
For example, when trying to view the vCenter web interface at https://vc.home.local, or trying to SSH into my PostgreSQL development box postgres-dev-01.home.local I&amp;rsquo;d just get ssh: Could not resolve hostname exit: Temporary failure in name resolution. This was made especially odd since an nslookup was able to resolve everything just fine:</description>
