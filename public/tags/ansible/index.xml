      <description>Goal After following this tutorial you should end up with a functional environment running OpenShift Origin. This environment will consist of 1 Master and 4 Nodes which isn&amp;rsquo;t a fully production-ready environment as ideally you will have multiple masters. We will be taking advantage of the OpenShift Ansible repository to tackle a majority of the heavy lifting, thus most of these steps fit into the &amp;ldquo;prep work&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;testing that everything worked as planned&amp;rdquo; category.</description>
