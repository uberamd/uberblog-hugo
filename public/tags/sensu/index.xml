      <description>Recently I migrated off of AWS Route53 to my own BIND servers for a few of my domains. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do this because I think I can do DNS better than the folks at Amazon. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to collect some detailed statistics about DNS usage and running my own DNS servers was the path of least resistance to reach that goal.
Prepping the DNS servers My DNS setup is fairly typical, with a master and slave DNS server, each one located on different sides of the US.</description>

      <description>The goal of this exercise is to create a Metric for Sensu that&amp;rsquo;ll poll the Unifi controller and display the signal strength of connected wireless devices. This will allow me to get a visual of the type of connection devices in my house are getting as well as let me somewhat track the comings and goings of my devices.
Because no scripts like this currently exist for Unifi, I had to dig in and see what my options were.</description>
