      <description>The general process for getting an early release of Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication 9.5 Update 1, which adds support for vCenter 6.5, is making a support ticket with Veeam asking for the RC.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through that hassle you can just download it directly here: https://download2.veeam.com/veeam_backup_9.5.0.802.update1.RC.zip
Usual disclaimer applies: is not official release software etc. etc. etc.</description>

      <description>The problem &amp;ndash; ASDM Won&amp;rsquo;t launch properly When setting up a Cisco ASA Virtual Appliance (ASAv) in my lab I ran into issues getting ASDM to launch properly. When attempting to login I&amp;rsquo;d be prompted with the message &amp;ldquo;Unable to launch device manager from X.X.X.X&amp;rdquo; as seen in the screenshot below:
The logs indicate it&amp;rsquo;s an error with how SSL is configured on the ASA:

      <title>install vmware vcenter 6 with less than 8gb ram</title>

      <description>Perhaps the most frustrating thing about vCenter 6 is the hard 8GB of RAM requirement to simply install the application on a Windows server. To a lot of people, including myself, carving out 8GB of RAM VM in a home lab just to run vCenter for a host or two is a big ask.
But beyond that, even if you&amp;rsquo;re using a physical computer that has exactly 8GB of installed RAM, if any of that RAM goes to an integrated video card, and thus doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear available to Windows, you&amp;rsquo;ll be blocked from running the VCenter installer as your system will have slightly less than a full 8GB of RAM.</description>
