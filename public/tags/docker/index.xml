      <description>Custom beginnings Back in 2014 I wrote a simple blog CMS in Ruby on Rails. It didn&amp;rsquo;t have the most features in the world but did have all the functionality I needed at the time, which included:
 Uploading images to AWS S3 and storing multiple sizes Visual editor for the Admin area Post tagging Syntax highlighting Comment system  It was pretty barebones but worked well enough. There was one major &amp;ldquo;shortcoming&amp;rdquo;, and that was the reliance on a database for storing posts.</description>

      <description>Quick background My job involves doing &amp;ldquo;DevOpsy&amp;rdquo; things for a company that develops and hosts APIs for clients. These APIs are the backends to various services you&amp;rsquo;ve likely heard of or interacted with at some point in time. Because our clients depend on the performance and availability of our exposed services, monitoring is one of our top priorities. Without flexible, reliable, code-driven monitoring we&amp;rsquo;re setting ourselves up for failure.
Our monitoring platform of choice is Sensu, which is an absolutely fantastic piece of open source goodness.</description>
