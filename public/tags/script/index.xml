      <description>This script, as well as similar scripts can be found on the internet but I tend to keep losing the pages that have it. So for my own archival reasons, as well as making it a little easier for others to find, here it is.
This script uses winrar to recursively extract rar archives. This is very useful if you legally download seasons of shows and don&amp;rsquo;t want to extract each episode one by one.</description>
