      <description>Recently I migrated off of AWS Route53 to my own BIND servers for a few of my domains. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do this because I think I can do DNS better than the folks at Amazon. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to collect some detailed statistics about DNS usage and running my own DNS servers was the path of least resistance to reach that goal.
Prepping the DNS servers My DNS setup is fairly typical, with a master and slave DNS server, each one located on different sides of the US.</description>
