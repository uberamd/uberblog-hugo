      <description>Quick background My job involves doing &amp;ldquo;DevOpsy&amp;rdquo; things for a company that develops and hosts APIs for clients. These APIs are the backends to various services you&amp;rsquo;ve likely heard of or interacted with at some point in time. Because our clients depend on the performance and availability of our exposed services, monitoring is one of our top priorities. Without flexible, reliable, code-driven monitoring we&amp;rsquo;re setting ourselves up for failure.
Our monitoring platform of choice is Sensu, which is an absolutely fantastic piece of open source goodness.</description>
