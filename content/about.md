I'm a 38 year old **systems development engineer** living in **Minneapolis, MN** doing **automation and cloud stuff**. Currently I work at [HealthPartners](https://www.healthpartners.com) and prior to that I worked at **[Amazon AWS](http://aws.com/)**.

Graduated from the **University of Minnesota** with a B.B.A. and focus on **MIS**

My technology interests include **automation**, **linux**, **containers**, **monitoring**,  **software development**, **hardware**, and some **networking**.

I've got a pretty kick-ass **[home lab](/post/homelab-progress/)** where I spend a lot of time learning new technologies.

More information about my professional experience can be found on my **[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/spmorrissey/)**.
